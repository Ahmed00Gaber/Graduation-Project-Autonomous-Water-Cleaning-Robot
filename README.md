# Graduation-Project-Autonomous-Water-Cleaning-Robot
Autonomous water cleaning robot navigates through waterways, utilizing a machine learning model to detect trash. Upon identification, the robot actively collects the debris. The system is built using the STM32 micro-controller, where a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) is implemented. 
In addition to its waste collection capabilities the robot is equipped with advanced sensors to continuously monitor TDS and pH levels.
